# FraudBoard
This work presents a framework to estimate investment into fraud websites in real-time, or close to
real-time, by collating open source information, and categorising via machine learning techniques. This
investment estimation is then used as a proxy for estimating profits, with the thought process that if
investment is going in to a website, it must be profitable.
